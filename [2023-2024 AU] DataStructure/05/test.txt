The Legal Affairs Commission, after examination, believes that laws and administrative regulations such as the Air Pollution Prevention and Control Law and the Fireworks and Fireworks Safety Management Regulations formulated by the State Council have not made comprehensive prohibitions on the sale and display of fireworks and firecrackers that meet quality standards. At the same time, it authorizes the people's government at or above the county level to designate time periods and areas for restricting or prohibiting the display of fireworks and firecrackers; The provisions of local regulations on the comprehensive prohibition of the sale and setting off of fireworks and firecrackers are inconsistent with the relevant provisions of the Air Pollution Prevention and Control Law and the Fireworks and Fireworks Safety Management Regulations; There are differences in understanding regarding the issue of comprehensive bans on sales and combustion, and it is also difficult to implement in practice. Therefore, it should be revised in accordance with the spirit of the superior law.
